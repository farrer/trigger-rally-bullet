In this file I'll (farrer) keep track of the changes for configurations,
vehicles or track files needed for the the Bullet Physics Trigger Rally.

Definitive Changes:
   - Defined a new action map for brake, instead of the previous way of using 
     the 'back action' sometimes to go backward, sometimes to brake. The back 
     action will now only do backward input and will only start to be 
     effective when the car is stopped (in fact, when is almost stopped, where 
     speed <= 0.5km/h);

Current Changes (will need to revert them or do some work to be definitive):
   - Circuits with negative positions won't work, as I only defined the
     physical mesh to be positive and without overlaping a :1 map definition;
   - For the same reason, the car will fall under rendered terrain on 
     positions negative or greater than the defined for the terrain size;
   - With the port of the DrivingSystemInstance to work with the values from
     Bullet instead of the wrong ones from previous physics implementation, 
     probably the cars engine will act somewhat different. I've tested only
     with Cordo KitCar (and it's acting like a KitCar, rarely going near
     100-120km/h). Will check latter the other ones;

Currently Broken (will probably fix them) :
   - Car height position is broken. It's easy to fix, but will do that
     when the physical definition is complete to avoid double work;
   - Every rendering related to wheel's positions and angles are currently 
     broken, as I did not ported the old values to the new ones (so, the
     wheels aren't moving on the rendered vehicle, the dust trails won't 
     work, etc.);
   - Car's drift (will need to check the torque applied on that and port it
     to Bullet's model);
   - Slow down when off the 'road'. In fact I do not like the effect of
     slowing the car when off the defined road. For me just the time penalty
     should be sufficient;
   - Wheel values from vehicle file are currently ignored;
   - TODO: should read and define all physical values from vehicle's file.
   - TODO: should check the terrain's friction.
