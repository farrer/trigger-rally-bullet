To build Trigger Rally, your system must satisfy the following requirements:

* have a C++ compiler (preferably g++ v.4.9+) and related binutils
* have the GNU Make utility
* have these development libraries installed:

To build Trigger Rally you must run "make" in the "src" directory where
"GNUmakefile" is located:

  $ cd src/
  $ make
  $ cd ../bin/
  $ ./trigger-rally

To install Trigger Rally you need to get superuser privileges and run "make install".
Note that installation is not required to play the game. The game can run as soon as
it finished building.

  $ su
  Password: 
  # make install
  # exit
  logout
  $ trigger-rally

----------------------
2. Packaging for Linux
----------------------

If you're an old packager tasked with keeping the software repository of a major Linux
distribution up-to-date then I really have no business telling you how to do your job.

If you're a novice packager you might want to look into staged installs, which the
provided GNUmakefile supports in accordance to the GNU guidelines (the DESTDIR variable):

  $ cd src/
  $ DESTDIR="/home/UserName/TR_staged" make install

Note that the "install" target will build Trigger Rally first, if needed.

Also note that you should probably set the OPTIMS variable to more conservative values,
to ensure that users of older hardware can still run the game.
As an example, the official 32-bit binary release for Windows is built with:

  $ OPTIMS="-march=i686 -mtune=generic -O2" make build

See the GCC documentation for the currently supported x86 options:

  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html

The "dist" target is also supported, and it creates a zipped tarball of the
Trigger Rally directory and then calculates the archive's MD5 sum.

Finally be sure to check the Trigger Rally default configuration file at:

  bin/trigger-rally.config.defs

and edit the default data paths accordingly. And yes this config file needs to stay
in the binary folder, for compatibility with the Windows build and for code simplicity.

3. Windows users
----------------

Building for Windows is supported officially with GNU Makefiles and Shell scripts.
You will need to download and install MSYS2, CMake, TDM-GCC and the TR build scripts,
then download the development libraries and finally run the TR build scripts:

  MSYS2                         https://msys2.github.io/

  TR Build Scripts              https://sourceforge.net/projects/trigger-rally/files/devkit/build_scripts/

Of course, you're expected to read the "build_readme.txt" file provided with the build scripts.

  ----------------------------------------------------

If you're using Visual Studio you're on your own for the time being, sorry.
That said, it shouldn't be too difficult to build the aforementioned dev libraries after
you read their ReadMe files (some may provide Solution files, while others may support NMAKE)
and then create a Trigger Rally C++11 Solution in which you include all the source files
from the "trigger-rally-VERSION\src\" folder.

4. Packaging for Windows
------------------------

Refer to the Trigger Rally Discussion forums if you have questions about packaging
the game for Windows. At the time of this writing, NSIS is used for the 32-bit build and
the WiX Toolset is planned to be used for future 64-bit builds:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/trigger-rally/discussion/
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/trigger-rally/files/devkit/TR_NSIS/
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/trigger-rally/files/devkit/TR_WiX/

The release version of Trigger Rally suppresses terrain information and codriver checkpoint visuals.
Developers can turn these on by defining the INDEVEL macro before building.

  $ cd trigger-rally-0.6.5/src/
  $ OPTIMS="-DINDEVEL" make
